# local-flam-paper
This repository compiles the required datasets, scripts and the data visualizations that are present in the Local Flammability paper produced by the Moritz Fire Lab at UCSB. The paper is authored by Indra Boving, Joe Celebrezze and Max Moritz (add authors as necessary). This paper looks at the relationship between flammability of two dominant chapparal species -- Ceanothus megacarpus and Adenostoma fasciculatum -- and water status (water potential) and content (LFM). In looking at this relationship, it also looks at the effects of different species and sampling years/months on this relationship. Plant-level flammability was measured using an epiradiator-style chamber over the course of 4 years (2016-2020).
